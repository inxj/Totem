# Totem — Business Summary (Draft)

> **Totem** brings together multiple independent builders under a single brand, operating model, and client experience to deliver **lower risk and higher profit** for partnered builders and Totem shareholders.

## What Totem is

- An Australian company that presents to the market as a unique builder and trade-services provider to the residential and commercial markets.

- Totem operates like a pseudo-partnership, integrating with small construction businesses and enhancing them with improved risk mitigation, resourcing, scheduling, brand, and administration.

- Builders are encouraged to **retain their licence and their existing corporate entity**, while operating collectively as *Totem Projects*. These entities become part of Totem via a bidirectional services agreement that supports revenue, cost, and services sharing.

- Totem begins as a corporate entity in possession of high-value intangible assets including brand, methodologies, and commercial agreements. In a second phase, it may additionally retain a large pool of qualified tradespersons as employees.

## What Totem does

**Build + Renovate + Repair**

Totem targets two complementary streams:

1. **Project builds/renovations** delivered through branded builder-owned entities (one lead entity per major project).
2. **Quoteless** repairs/maintenance/improvements that smooth demand and reduce downtime using advanced automated scheduling and a quoteless commercial structure for small jobs.

## Why Totem exists

Australia has strong infrastructure and housing demand (including a \~\$242b five‑year major public infrastructure pipeline) but chronic constraints:

- Trades shortages and fragmentation (Australia needs \~117,000 additional tradespeople to meet National Housing Accord goals, and a majority of construction firms are sole traders).
- Volatility and insolvency risk across small construction businesses (construction businesses account for \~27% of insolvencies each year).
- Significant unmet demand for repair/maintenance and reliable delivery (\~80 million outstanding home repair/maintenance projects worth \~\$40b; \~50% of homeowners report difficulty finding a reliable tradie who will show up on time).
- Proven profitability with large construction firms (>200 people) realising almost twice the revenue per employee as smaller firms.
